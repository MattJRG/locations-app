# LocationsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.

The Locations App allows a user to view the locations data stored in the locations.json file in the projects assets
folder. Users are able to edit and delete locations as well as add new ones. As the dataset is quite large pagination
has been implemented to improve performance and improve UX.

All application state management is handled by the LocationStore which is a NgRx Component Store.
